    "text": "This data set focuses on wages and education levels in Canada.\nIn our exploratory data analysis (EDA), we have examined the data set through several steps: inspecting the data, making assumptions about the variables, validating those assumptions, summarizing the information, applying filters, visualizing the patterns, and finally, drawing meaningful insights.\n\n\n\nQualitative Variables\n\nlanguage: Factor indicating language. Language refers to English, French or Other. “Other” refers to languages that are not English and French.\nsex: Factor indicating sex. Sex refers to either Male or Female.\n\nQuantitative Variables\n\nage: age in years.\neducation: total years of education.\nwages: amount of wages earned on an hourly basis in dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expected individuals from “other” language groups to face disadvantages in education and wages compared to English or French speakers.\nWe also assumed that cultural or community-specific factors might provide additional support for women in “french” and “english” language groups, leading to higher outcomes than women from the “other” language group.\nPeople above the age of 60/retired personnel were included in the data collection process.\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

Drawing on a past data set experience, we assumed that empty cells could sometimes encode hidden meanings (e.g., “No”s on all ethnic markers in a previous data set implied “Caucasian”).\n\n\n\nConvert sex and language into factors (from characters).\nRearrange columns to place sex and language before age, education, and wages.\nRemove NAs in education, since values like 0 appeared to be intentionally recorded, whereas NA did not seem meaningful. This step removed approximately 121 entries.\nRemove NAs in languages, based on the reasoning that special languages (such as sign language) would likely have been coded under “other”.\n\n\nWages_mod1 &lt;- Wages %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    sex = as.factor(sex),\n    language = as.factor(language)\n  ) %&gt;%\n \n  dplyr::relocate(sex, language, age, education, wages, .after= rownames)\nWages_mod1\n\n# A tibble: 7,425 × 6\n   rownames sex    language   age education wages\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        1 Male   English     40      15    10.6\n 2        2 Male   English     19      13.2  11  \n 3        3 Male   Other       49      16    NA  \n 4        4 Male   Other       46      14    17.8\n 5        5 Male   English     71       8    NA  \n 6        6 Female English     50      16    14  \n 7        7 Female English     70      12    NA  \n 8        8 Female English     42      14.5  NA  \n 9        9 Male   English     31      15     8.2\n10       10 Female English     56      10    NA  \n# ℹ 7,415 more rows\n\n\n\nWages_mod2 &lt;- Wages_mod1 %&gt;% \n  tidyr::drop_na(education, language) \n  Wages_mod2\n\n# A tibble: 7,125 × 6\n   rownames sex    language   age education wages\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        1 Male   English     40      15    10.6\n 2        2 Male   English     19      13.2  11  \n 3        3 Male   Other       49      16    NA  \n 4        4 Male   Other       46      14    17.8\n 5        5 Male   English     71       8    NA  \n 6        6 Female English     50      16    14  \n 7        7 Female English     70      12    NA  \n 8        8 Female English     42      14.5  NA  \n 9        9 Male   English     31      15     8.2\n10       10 Female English     56      10    NA  \n# ℹ 7,115 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a better idea of the data set, we decided to summarize between different variables. \nFirst, we decided to see the overall picture without language.\nWe summarized wages, education, and sample counts by sex while dropping missing values.\nThe results showed a clear gender wage gap:\n\nWages_mod2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(sex) %&gt;%\n  summarize(wages = mean(wages, na.rm=T),\n            education = mean(education), \n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  sex    wages education count\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Female  13.8      12.4  3742\n2 Male    17.2      12.6  3383\n\n\nDespite comparable education levels, females consistently earned less per hour than males, a difference of nearly $3.40/hour on average.\nThis finding was striking given the similar education levels between the two groups.\nNext we grouped the data by language to see whether wages varied by linguistic background. The results were:\n\nWages_mod2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(language) %&gt;%\n  summarize(wages = mean(wages, na.rm=T),\n            education = mean(education), \n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  language wages education count\n  &lt;fct&gt;

This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."

    "text": "From our exploratory analysis, it is clear that the gender wage gap persists regardless of language or educational attainment, suggesting that systemic factors outweigh individual qualifications.\nWhile women’s earnings peak in their 30s–40s, they plateau or decline afterward, whereas men’s wages continue to rise steadily into their 50s and 60s, benefiting from seniority and career progression. This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."

The results were:\n\nWages_mod2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(language) %&gt;%\n  summarize(wages = mean(wages, na.rm=T),\n            education = mean(education), \n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  language wages education count\n  &lt;fct&gt;

This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."

    "text": "From our exploratory analysis, it is clear that the gender wage gap persists regardless of language or educational attainment, suggesting that systemic factors outweigh individual qualifications.\nWhile women’s earnings peak in their 30s-40s, they plateau or decline afterward, whereas men’s wages continue to rise steadily into their 50s and 60s, benefiting from seniority and career progression. This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."

The results were:\n\nWages_mod2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(language) %&gt;%\n  summarize(wages = mean(wages, na.rm=T),\n            education = mean(education), \n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  language wages education count\n  &lt;fct&gt;

This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."

    "text": "From our exploratory analysis, it is clear that the gender wage gap persists regardless of language or educational attainment, suggesting that systemic factors outweigh individual qualifications.\nWhile women’s earnings peak in their 30s-40s, they plateau or decline afterward, whereas men’s wages continue to rise steadily into their 50s and 60s, benefiting from seniority and career progression. This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."
